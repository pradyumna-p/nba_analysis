# nba_analysis
This is a data science project that I have done using Python. It includes the following:
1. Data Scraping using Python
2. Data Cleaning and Exploration
3. Data Analysis and Data Visualization


I have completely relied on Python for this project using the Pandas, Numpy and MatPlotLib libraries.
